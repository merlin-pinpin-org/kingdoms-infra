# Roll back the Kingdoms stack to its last known-good state.
#
# Two paths (ADR-0018, the state is the source of truth):
#
# - automatic (called by deploy.sh after a failed health gate): re-apply the
#   previous pinned state — the stack keeps running the last known-good
#   image without touching any data. The state-branch revert runs only
#   where the state branch accepts a direct push from the deploy pipeline
#   (deploy/test); on prod the push is blocked by the "Deploy PROD" ruleset
#   (required PR), so the automatic path restores the latest DB backup
#   instead and flags the incident loudly.
#
# - manual (operator-run): restore the most recent backup (or a given
#   archive) on top of the state revert.
#
# The automatic path never reverts code on main and never touches any
# repository other than this one — a rejected deployment rolls the pinned
# state back, not the source (the accidental revert of a docs commit taught
# us that).
